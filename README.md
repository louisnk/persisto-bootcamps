- Able to confidently explain `flow control`, basic `asyncronous request handling` (callbacks), and basic `CSS properties`

- Previous experience mentoring in some capacity (not necessarily with code or kids)
- Able to join us in Tbilisi for `>= 15 days`. (At least 3 days getting settled before they start working with kids)

### Nice to have

### Mentorship Traits
- Excercising patience when working with students
- Able to break down technical concepts into simple, easy-to-digest bits.

- Adaptable, warm, friendly.
